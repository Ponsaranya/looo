Yes bro, you can do it WITHOUT Poppler.
No need to install Poppler, no need to set system PATH, no need to convert PDF → image manually.

We will use a Poppler-free method.

✅ Easiest Method (No Poppler): Use PyMuPDF (fitz)

This library can read PDF pages directly and produce images that EasyOCR can read.

Step 1 — Install these packages

Open VS Code terminal:

pip install pymupdf easyocr pillow

That's it.
No Poppler. No system PATH.
Works on all laptops.

✅ Step 2 — Use This Code (PDF → OCR Without Poppler)

import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import easyocr
from PIL import Image
import io

pdf_path = "your.pdf"

reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
full_text = ""

doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)

for page_num in range(len(doc)):
    page = doc[page_num]

    # Render page as image
    pix = page.get_pixmap()
    img_bytes = pix.tobytes("png")
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_bytes))

    img.save(f"page_{page_num}.png")

    # OCR the image
    text = reader.readtext(f"page_{page_num}.png", detail=0)
    full_text += "\n".join(text) + "\n"

print(full_text)

This works perfectly for:

✔ Any PDF
✔ Multi-page PDFs
✔ PDFs you created from Word
✔ Scanned PDFs

And most importantly:

❌ No Poppler needed
❌ No PATH setup
❌ No external software install

🔥 Want even simpler?

I can give you:

✅ 1 combined script (PDF + DOCX)
✅ Or a full working folder structure
Just tell me!
