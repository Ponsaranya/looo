Yes bro, exactly correct.
Let me confirm everything step-by-step in a very simple way:


---

✅ 1. Install only the required packages

In VS Code terminal, install these:

pip install easyocr pdf2image pillow python-docx

That's it.
(One-time installation)


---

✅ 2. Yes, you can create your own PDF / Word files

You can create:

✔ Word document

Use:

MS Word, or

Google Docs, or

Notepad → Save As → .docx (not recommended)
Better to use Word or Google Docs.


✔ PDF file

You can create:

From Word → Save as PDF

From Notepad → Print → Save as PDF

Any simple content you want (2–3 pages is fine)


EasyOCR will work normally on your own PDFs.


---

✅ 3. After creating your PDF, write the PDF OCR code

Example code you will write:

from pdf2image import convert_from_path
import easyocr

pdf_path = "your_file.pdf"

pages = convert_from_path(pdf_path)
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])

full_text = ""

for i, page in enumerate(pages):
    img_path = f"page_{i}.png"
    page.save(img_path, "PNG")

    text = reader.readtext(img_path, detail=0)
    full_text += "\n".join(text) + "\n"

print(full_text)

Run it:

python your_pdf_code.py


---

🎉 So final confirmation:

✔ Step 1: Install packages

✔ Step 2: Create PDF / Word file yourself

✔ Step 3: Write the OCR code

✔ Step 4: Run it in VS Code → You get extracted text

If you want, I can also create:

🟦 Full ready-made folder structure
🟦 Combined code for PDF + DOCX
🟦 Sample PDF content

Just tell me!
